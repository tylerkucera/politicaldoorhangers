						<span class="lquote">“</span>I used politicaldoorhangers.com in my 2010 campaign for Cuyahoga County Council. The door hangers were very effective -  I won with over 75% of the vote.  The company did a great job of targeting voters and delivering the product.  I have recommended them to other candidates and would surely use them again if I were ever a candidate.<span class="rquote">”</span>

						<span class="lquote">“</span>I have known Rick Ferrell for 15 years, on both business and personal levels, and have always been impressed with his drive, determination and tenaciousness. He possesses the necessary skills to make every venture he becomes involved in a success for his client as well as his own company. I have been around the block a few times. I have enough experience to recognize integrity when I see it, and Rick Ferrell is one of the good ones. Therefore, I have no hesitation in recommending him and his company, and am pleased to write this letter on his behalf.<span class="rquote">”</span>

						<span class="lquote">“</span>James and Rick were very beneficial to my campaign.  I met with James during distribution and have nothing but good things to say on the way he managed the crew. He paid special attention to my high target areas ensuring every house had a door hanger on it.  You also cannot replace the person to person advertising James was able to perform while supervising the distribution in my neighborhoods.<span class="rquote">”</span>
